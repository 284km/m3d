# Open questions (m3d)

Decisions not yet made, written down where they can be found rather than
rediscovered. The format is the one the Mere project uses: a question, what is
known, the candidates, and — where a machine can be asked — a command that
**exits 0 while the question is still open**, so a stale entry is detectable
instead of merely embarrassing.

## Q-1: the vertex layout — array of structs or struct of arrays

- **State**: open, measured but not decided.
- **Measured** (`bench/layout.mere`, 200,000 points x 40, C backend): AoS 12.3 ms,
  SoA 11.1 ms, bit-identical answers. About 10% to SoA.
- **Why it is not decided**: that 10% is the ADDRESS PATTERN and nothing else.
  The reason SoA is normally chosen is that a wide lane can load four x's in
  one instruction, and the language has no `f32x4_load` — both layouts go
  through `vec_get`, one scalar at a time. Deciding now would be deciding on
  the wrong axis. AoS also has an argument the benchmark cannot see: a glTF
  accessor hands over interleaved data, so SoA costs a de-interleaving pass at
  load time that this measurement does not include.
- **Revisit when**: a load builtin exists, and the loader is written so the
  de-interleaving cost is real rather than hypothetical.
- **Verify**: `! "$MERE" -te 'f32x4_load' >/dev/null 2>&1`
  (ask the compiler, not the documentation: the stdlib reference contains the string
  `f32x4_load` in the sentence saying there is no such builtin, so a grep for it would
  report this question as answered by the paragraph explaining that it is not.)

## Q-6: is a little-endian read worth a builtin

- **State**: open, measured, and the answer is **not yet** — recorded rather than acted on.
- glTF is little-endian throughout, and `bytes_get` reads one byte, so every multi-byte
  value in the format is four reads and three shifts in `src/bytes_le.mere`. The language
  has no `bytes_get_u32le`. The question is whether that costs enough to add one.
- **Measured** (`bench/le.mere` and a C reference, 2,000,000 values x 20 passes, C backend):

  | | Mere | C, the same shifts | C, one unaligned load |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | assembling a u32 | 37 ms | 13 ms | **3.0 ms** |
  | reading an f32 **as an accessor does** | **69 ms** | -- | 66 ms |

- **The float row is the one that decides it.** A vertex buffer is float, and there Mere
  is already at C's speed: the conversion and the arithmetic dominate, and the assembly
  hides behind them. A builtin would buy nothing on the data that makes up the bulk of a
  model.
- The integer row is a real gap -- 12x against a single load -- and it is the index
  buffer, which is a fraction of the size of the vertex data. A model would have to be
  index-heavy in a way none in `test/data` is before that mattered.
- **Revisit when**: a real model's load time is measured and the index read is a visible
  share of it. Guessing that it will be is what this measurement is here to prevent.
- **Verify**: `! "$MERE" -te 'bytes_get_u32le' >/dev/null 2>&1`

## Q-7: glTF-Embedded (`data:` URIs) needs base64, which the language has as an example

- **State**: open, deliberately out of scope for the loader's first slice.
- A `data:application/octet-stream;base64,...` URI is one of glTF's three container
  shapes. The loader **refuses it by name** rather than mis-reading it as a filename.
- The language has base64 in `examples/base64_bytes.mere` -- over `bytes`, byte-identical
  on all four backends -- and *not* in `contrib/`. Two contrib modules (`auth/jwt`,
  `http/basic_auth`) already mention base64, so this would be a third consumer and the
  argument for promoting it is close to made. That promotion is a change to the language
  repository, not to this one.
- **Verify**: `! ls "$MERE_SRC/contrib/encoding/base64.mere" >/dev/null 2>&1`

## Q-2: does `linalg` belong in the language's `contrib/`

- **State**: open. It stays here until there is a second consumer.
- The Mere project's granularity rule is that a library moves to `contrib/`
  when a second program actually imports it, not when it looks general. One
  program using it cannot tell a real generalization from a fake one.
- **Candidates for the second consumer**: a physics or collision module, an
  STL/OBJ viewer, the compiler's own benchmark suite (`mat4xvec4` currently
  writes its matrix arithmetic out by hand).
- **Verify**: none — this is a decision, not a symptom.

## Q-3: `mat4` as four `v4` columns, or as a flat buffer

- **State**: decided for now (four columns), open to revision.
- Four columns is a value type on the C and LLVM backends — a by-value struct,
  no allocation — and it reads like the mathematics: `r = c0*x + c1*y + c2*z + c3*w`.
- What might change it: the loader wants to read sixteen floats straight out of
  a glTF accessor into a matrix, and a flat `Vec[R, float]` would be a memcpy
  where this is sixteen field assignments. Whether that matters is a
  measurement nobody has taken.
- **Verify**: none — a decision.

## Q-4: where the exactness line goes when shading arrives

- **State**: open, and the first thing M1c will have to settle.
- Today the line is clean: everything a glTF file needs uses only the five
  correctly-rounded operations, and the trigonometry is fenced off. Shading
  breaks that — sRGB encoding is `pow(x, 1/2.4)` and the GGX distribution is
  full of it — so the pixel path cannot be bit-exact across backends.
- **Candidates**: (a) a 256-entry sRGB lookup table, so `pow` is called at
  table-build time and the per-pixel path stays exact; (b) accept a
  quantized-plus-or-minus-one tolerance on pixels and keep bit-exactness for
  geometry only; (c) both, which is probably the answer.
- **Verify**: none yet — there is no shading code to ask.

## Q-5: `V3.normalize` of a zero vector returns zero

- **State**: decided, recorded because it is a choice and not a law.
- A degenerate triangle has a zero normal. Returning a NaN would be the
  arithmetic's answer, and a NaN spreads silently into every pixel it touches;
  a zero is visible and local. The same reasoning applies to
  `V4.perspective_divide` at w = 0, which returns the point unprojected rather
  than three infinities, and leaves clipping to the caller.
- What would change it: a caller that needs to distinguish "no direction" from
  "the zero direction". None exists yet.
- **Verify**: none — a decision.
