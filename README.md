# m3d

A 3D renderer in [Mere](https://merelang.org/), built to run glTF.

**Right now it is the arithmetic and nothing else.** `src/linalg.mere` is vectors,
matrices, quaternions and the two camera projections; there is no loader, no
rasterizer and no window yet. What is here is held to three separate checks,
and the shape of those checks is the reason this exists in the order it does.

## Building

Needs a built `mere`. No dependencies of its own.

```
MERE=/path/to/mere.exe MERE_SRC=/path/to/mere-checkout sh scripts/check.sh
```

`MERE_SRC` is optional and only adds the Wasm backend, which needs that
repository's Node host; without it the Wasm column is skipped **and says so**,
because three backends agreeing is a weaker statement than four and a gate
should not quietly become weaker.

## Three readers, each seeing what the others cannot

`scripts/linalg_check.sh` runs all three, and each one exists because the
others are blind to something:

**The four backends against each other, exactly.** Everything in the exact part
of `src/linalg.mere` uses only `+ - * /` and `sqrt` — the five operations
IEEE-754 requires to be correctly rounded — so the interpreter, the C backend,
LLVM and Wasm must print the *same bits*. That check needs no oracle: they are
each other's, and a single differing bit is a bug rather than a rounding story.
It is why the trigonometry is fenced into its own part of the file.

**A second implementation, by a different route.** Four backends running one
source agree about a wrong formula as readily as a right one.
`scripts/gen_linalg_expected.py` computes the same answers with Gauss-Jordan
where this uses Laplace, a quaternion sandwich `q v q*` where this uses the
expanded closed form, and a general frustum where this writes the entries
directly. Different rounding, so it compares in ulps: 136 values, worst 16.

**The properties, with no second implementation at all.**
`test/linalg_props.mere` asks whether a cross product is perpendicular to its
inputs, whether a rotation preserves length, whether inverting and multiplying
back gives the identity. Those are facts about the *answer*; no amount of
agreement between implementations establishes them.

The division of labour was measured rather than assumed. Replacing
`Q.to_mat4` with its transpose — the inverse rotation, which is still perfectly
orthonormal, still determinant 1, still length-preserving — leaves the
four-backend check green (they all run the same source) and leaves the
orthonormality properties green too. It is caught by the second route, loudly,
and by exactly one property: that composing quaternions matches multiplying
their matrices, which fails because a transpose reverses the order.

## Exact and inexact

`sin`, `cos` and `tan` are not required by anyone to be correctly rounded, and
Mere's four backends measurably disagree in the last bit. So `src/linalg.mere`
is split: everything a glTF file needs is above the line and exact, and the
trigonometry is below it, used only by an interactive camera and by
axis-angle construction, which a file never asks for. A file gives a rotation
as a quaternion and a camera as a field of view; the first goes straight into
`Q.to_mat4`, and the second passes through `tan` once per frame.

## Conventions

Column-major, so `mat4` is four columns and element (row *i*, column *j*) is
`c<j>`'s *i*-th field — glTF's layout and OpenGL's. Right-handed, +Y up, −Z
forward, clip z in [−1, 1]. A quaternion is stored (x, y, z, w) with w last,
as glTF stores it. `M4x.inverse` returns an **option**: a singular matrix is an
ordinary thing to meet — a zero scale on a node makes one — and answering the
identity instead would be a wrong answer that survives all the way to a pixel.

## Vertex layout: measured, and not yet decided

`bench/layout.mere` transforms 200,000 points 40 times through each layout and
checks the two agree to the bit before reporting either time. Array-of-structs
12.3 ms, struct-of-arrays 11.1 ms — SoA about 10% ahead.

That number is **not** the usual argument for SoA and should not be read as
one. There is no `f32x4_load` in the language yet, so neither layout can be
read a vector at a time: both go through `vec_get`, one scalar at a time, and
what is left is the address pattern — one stride of 3 against three strides of
1. The measurement is here so that when a load builtin arrives, the before is
on record.

## What is not here yet

The glTF loader, the rasterizer, materials, the window, animation and skinning,
and the GPU path. See `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.
